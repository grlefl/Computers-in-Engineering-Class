Notes (complete)
- fin.good() - to check for EOF in a while loop, trips up over no whitespace at the end
- fin.eof() - checks for end of file, works with no whitespace at the end
- fin.fail() I'm not sure what this does, checking for failure
Practice (complete)
- write a program to compute average list of numbers stored in a file using EOF file format
